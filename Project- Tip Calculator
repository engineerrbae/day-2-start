#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 
#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª

Solution:

print("Welcome to the Tip Calculator")
bill = input("What was the total bill? $")
tip = input("what percentage tip would like to give? 10,12 or 15? ")
people = input("How many people to split the bill? ")

tip_value = (float(tip)/100)+1
mutiply_bill_tippercent = float(bill)*tip_value
Final_tip = mutiply_bill_tippercent/5
# answer = str(round (Final_tip))
print(f'Each person should pay: ${Final_tip:.2f}')

Output: 

Welcome to the Tip Calculator
What was the total bill? $153.45
what percentage tip would like to give? 10,12 or 15? 15
How many people to split the bill? 5
Each person should pay: $35.29
